# 🌾 Length of Growing Period in Climate Change Scenario

A climate change impact study focused on calculating **Potential Evapo-Transpiration (PET)** and assessing its effect on the **Length of Growing Period (LGP)** using future climate data.

📍 **Study Area**: Navsari region, Gujarat, India  
🧪 **Tools Used**: R programming, climate models, ggplot2 for visualization

---

## 🔍 Project Objective

To estimate how **climate change** affects the agricultural growing period by:
- Computing **PET** using climate variables
- Analyzing changes in **Length of Growing Period**
- Visualizing trends under **future climate scenarios**

---

## 🧰 Tools & Packages

- **R Programming**
- 📦 R Packages:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `lubridate`
- 📈 Climate Data:
  - Future projections (CMIP6, RCP scenarios)

---

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical & future temperature, rainfall, and humidity data.
2. **PET Calculation**: Use temperature-based Thornthwaite method.
3. **Growing Period Estimation**:
   - Determine thresholds for moisture availability
   - Calculate start and end of growing period based on PET and precipitation
4. **Visualization**:
   - Use `ggplot2` to analyze temporal trends and shifts in growing period
